## Asking for Help

Striking the right balance between learning independently and seeking assistance is key to growth. Here's a general guideline to help you decide when to ask for help, based on how long you've been stuck on the same issue:

- **1h**: Investigate and problem-solve independently.
- **Up to one day**: Collaborate with your group to work through the issue together.
- **After one day**: If the problem persists, will seek assistance from our instructor
